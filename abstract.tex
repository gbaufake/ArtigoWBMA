Some Brazilian Federal organizations have started to use agile methods on software development contracts. In such situation, it has been observed a weakness on measuring internal quality of outsourced software. This work proposes an automated solution, based on data warehousing environment, which may measure the quality of source code in order to be approved or rejected by a contractor. Therefore, this paper conducted a initial case study, as an empirical working evidence of that automated solution, that evaluated the 24 monthly releases of Sistema Integrado de Gest√£o e Conhecimento (SIGC) from IPHAN, the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, which had represented more than 39.000 source code lines evaluated.
