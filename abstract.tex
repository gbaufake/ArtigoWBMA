Some organizations of Federal Brazilian Government have started to use agile
methods on software development contracts. In that situation, it has been
observed a weakness on measuring internal quality of software outsourced. 
This work proposes an
automated solution, based on data warehousing environment, which may measure
the quality of source code in order to be approved or rejected by contractor. 
Therefore, this paper conducted a initial case study, as an empirical working 
evidence of that automated solution, that evaluated the 24 monthly releases 
of Sistema Integrado de Gest√£o e Conhecimento (SIGC) from IPHAN, 
which had represented more than 39.000 source code lines evaluated.
